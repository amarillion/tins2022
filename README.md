## Story ##

Ten years after our previous adventure, we find ourselves again
with our heroes, Fole the cat and Raul the monkey. And guess what,
it's time to do the laundry again!

Fole loads all the whites, taking care not to mix any colored
laundry. But was he careful enough? After the machine has started,
Raul finds a single red sock in his sock drawer. What happened to the 
others? Were they accidentally mixed in?

Raul has to return into the laundry machine yet again, to find 
all seven of his red socks and save the white wash. That's easier
said than done, because the spirit of Fole remains inside 
to make his life difficult.

## How to play ##

Your main objective is to find 'Shark Fole' and defeat him.

On the way, you have to collect as many red socks as you can.
Can you find all 7?

Avoid spikes and enemies.

Shiny rings give you a little boost to your hit-points.

If you find a hat, collect it! It is an extra life.

Use the big switches to change the water level.
Some areas are only accessible if the water level is just right.

You can find a teleporter to quickly go between 
opposing ends of the map.

Use the arrow keys to move, and space to jump.

Use the left Ctrl key or the left Shirt key to use your catapult
and pelt rocks at your enemies. But be careful: your
catapult doesn't work under water!

## Known issues ##

There are a few known bugs that I didn't have time to fix
* You can sometimes get trapped by spikes or an enemy with no way to recover.
* Not every key can be reconfigured in the settings menu.
* The fullscreen option does not work.

## Competition Rules ##

Here is how we chose to implement the special rules that were drawn at the 
start of the competition.

	genre rule #102:
	Theme: water / wet.

The game is set inside the pipes and machinery of a laundry machine. There is
a varying water level, which you can manipulate using switches. There are watery
sounds, and the music adapts to the wetness of your environment.

	artistical rule #123:
	You must integrate subliminal messages into your game.

There is a subliminal message hidden in the sound track.

	artistical rule #62:
	Have teleporters in your game.

There is a pair of teleporters that takes you between opposing sides of the map.

	technical rule #108:
	Implement and use any image post-processing filter.

There was no time left to implement a post-processing filter. We invoke the bonus rule.

	bonus rule #28:
	All your base are belong to us. You may modify or skip a rule if you cleverly use internet memes to explain your reasons.

The game contains three memes that explain your motivation to collect red socks!
You can find these in the Intro screen, The 'Game Over' screen and the 'Game Completed' screen.

## Code re-use ##

We consider this a sequel to our (Max + Amarillion) TINS 2012 entry.
Some sound effects and game object logic was copied from that entry.

Pixel art was hand-crafted during the competition, with a few exceptions:
some frames from Raul's animation, as well as one enemy sprite, was copied from
our TINS 2012 entry.

The latest version of Amarillion's 'twist' engine was uploaded to github 
just before the start of the competition.
